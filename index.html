          <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency, and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram, Kalam continued his education at Saint Josephâ€™s College in Tiruchirappalli, which was formerly a part of the University of Madras.He earned a physics degree from this institution in 1954, and he moved to Madras in 1955 to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering there.He came in ninth in the qualifiers, and there were only eight seats available in the Indian Air Force, thus he simply missed realizing his dream of becoming a fighter pilot.After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
